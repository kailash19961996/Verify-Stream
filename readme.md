## Features

- **YouTube Video Verification**: Input any YouTube URL to analyze its content.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes advanced AI models to transcribe and analyze video content.
- **Fact-Checking**: Generates smart prompts and performs Google searches to verify claims.
- **Verdict Generation**: Provides a concise verdict on the truthfulness of the video content.
- **Fake News Generation**: Demonstrates how AI can be used to create convincing misinformation.

## How It Works

1. **Audio Extraction**: Downloads audio from the provided YouTube URL.
2. **Transcription**: Uses the Whisper model to transcribe the audio content.
3. **Content Analysis**: Employs GPT models to describe the video content and generate fact-checking prompts.
4. **Web Scraping**: Performs Google searches based on the generated prompts and extracts relevant information.
5. **Verification**: Analyzes the scraped data to provide a final verdict on the video's claims.
6. **Fake News Generation**: Creates an opposite narrative and generates fake news content to demonstrate AI's potential misuse.

While it can be a powerful tool for fact-checking, it also showcases how AI can be used to generate misleading content. Users are encouraged to use this tool responsibly and critically evaluate all information, regardless of its source.

## Disclaimer
